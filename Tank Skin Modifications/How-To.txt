MCT v2

BASE FILES:
This will show you how to create the crashedTracksBase.wotmod and DeadTanksBase.wotmod files. 

step 1.)  open mct2_ct-dt_white.bat-file in editor
step 2.)  line 3: use your installation path here
step 3.)  line 5+6: use your installation path and current game version 
          this will rename the created files to the relhax-default names.
          and it will delete old versions if they are still in the mods folder.
step 4.)  run the bat
step 5.)  go to your mods\version dir. you will find the MCT.wotmods.
          now you will notice if step 3 failed. 
          if so, you need to manually edit the wotmods names.
step 6.)  update the zip with the new wotmods.


COLORFILES:
in some cases the colorfiles also need an update.
in order to do that you need to edit all *.bat files with the correct path/wotversion before running them.
run one bat.
from the created wotmod extract the colorfile and put it into the zip (without wotmod).
run the next bat.
repeat...


ATTENTION:
this mod is using a patch for the "load_order.xml".
this means that there is a reference to the current name of the .wotmod files!
so you have to rename the wotmod or edit the load_order.xml every time after creating.
