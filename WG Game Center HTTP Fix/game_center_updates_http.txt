Required programs:
Relhax Modpack (V2) - https://relhaxmodpack.com/relhax-v2-official-public-beta/

(If you can’t download .torrent files over HTTP or using just the modpack fails) 
Tor browser - https://www.torproject.org/
SocksCap64 - https://sourceforge.net/projects/sockscap64/

Steps:
Download and install the above programs
Open Relhax Modpack
Click “Diagnostic Utilities”
Click “Download WG patch files…”
Select the exe (or ico) of the WG client you wish to download updates for and click next
Close the Game Center if it is currently open
Wait until the window populates with update information and click next
Wait for the Application to download the required files.
After Complete, close the modpack and open the game center.
The game center should detect the new files, hash them to verify integrity, and immediately install them.

(If you can’t download .torrent files over HTTP or using just the modpack fails)
Open the Tor Browser from the “Tor Browser” folder -> “Start Tor Browser” shortcut and minimize it.
Close the Game Center if it is open
Open SocksCap64 (admin if you can, but normal should work).
Click the arrow to the right of “Apps” and click “Add an executable file”
Give the profile a name
For command line, click Browse and navigate to “C:\ProgramData\Wargaming.net\GameCenter” and click on “wgc.exe”
Click OK
Click the “Proxy” Button
Click the plus button in the Proxy Manager window or right click under “Local Socks” and click “Add a new proxy”
Double click inside the Address and type “127.0.0.1”
Double click inside the Port and type “9150”
Click Save
Highlight the Game center Icon and click the “Run button”
It will be slow, but it should now perform any previously blocked HTTP activity. It should proceed to step 10.
